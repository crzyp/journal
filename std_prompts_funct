import random     #included in standard lib

#function description:
#this function takes no parameters. 
#It returns a list of 5 strings/prompts that are randomly chosen from our list of potential prompts.
#Expected use: function should be called when displaying the home page to decide the label of the buttons
#              under the alternative prompts section. Each element of the returned list should be the label
#              for one button and if the button is pressed it should open an entry box with that element as the first line
